# Hi there, I'm Ivan! 👋

I'm a **Data Science Student** with a passion for building and a curiosity that never sleeps. I love taking complex theoretical concepts and turning them into deployable solutions.

**🔭 Current Focus:**
I am currently researching **Variational Manifold Learning**, specifically looking at how we can use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn and smooth the probability distribution of Transformer embeddings.
