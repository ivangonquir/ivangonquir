# Hi there, I'm Ivan! 👋

I'm a Data Science Student interested in a wide variety of topics who loves creating cool things. I firmly believe that growth happens during the most difficult challenges, which is why I enjoy facing complex problems to test my limits!


**🔭 Current Focus**

I am currently researching **Variational Manifold Learning**, specifically looking at how we can use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn and smooth the probability distribution of Transformer embeddings.
